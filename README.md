# SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime samples

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples) [![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples)


This project contains sample applications for building extensions using lambdas and microservices on [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/12/get-a-fully-managed-runtime-based-on-kyma-and-kubernetes/).

The samples are implemented in multiple languages and demonstrate various Kyma runtime features and use case scenarios. Developers should be able to refer to these samples and implement their own business scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Running various samples requires access to the Kyma runtime. There are also other sample-specific requirements that you can find in the *Prerequisites* section of each sample. An overview of prerequisites is available in the [prerequisites](prerequisites/README.md) directory.

## Samples

ðŸš€ Jumpstart your Kyma journey by using these samples to build event and api based extensions in your favorite technology. We have grouped the samples focusing on their content "center of gravity". But maybe there is more in there, so it is always worth to take a look at all of them ðŸ˜Ž

>>In case you are using [Visual Studio Code]() you can open each of the samples as a dedicated workspace. You find the corresponding file in the [workspaces](workspaces) directory
