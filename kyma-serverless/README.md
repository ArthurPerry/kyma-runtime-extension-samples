## Download and Installation
It is recommended to use a SAP BTP Free Tier account as both SAP BTP. Kyma runtime and SAP HANA Cloud are available there as free tier services.  

  * In order to avoid incurring any unwanted charges, please always read the "small print" when provisioning services on your SAP BTP Free Tier account.  
  * You can follow the consumption of both free and paid services via [SAP for me](https://me.sap.com) portal.

As aforementioned, both Kyma and Gardener are available as open source projects. Please refer to the prerequistes section above if you want to follow this path.
